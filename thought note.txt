I began by setting up the backend of my project using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. The process involved creating the server file first, establishing a connection with the MongoDB database. Following that, I developed models for various components of my project, including `category.js`, `order.js`, `products.js`, and `user.js`. 

Subsequently, I progressed to creating routes for different functionalities of my web application:

1. Auth Routes: In the `auth` route file, I implemented two routes for user authentication: `login` and `register`.

2. Category Routes: I created routes in the `category` route file to manage categories, such as creating a category, fetching all categories, fetching a category by ID, and deleting a category by ID.

3. File Routes: For handling file uploads and downloads, I established routes in the `file` route file.

4. Order Routes: In the `order` route file, I defined routes to fetch all orders (for admin) and fetch orders for individual users.

5. Payment Routes: Utilizing Braintree as the payment gateway, I created routes in the `payment` route file for creating orders upon successful transaction completion.

6. Product Routes: Managing products involved routes for adding, editing, updating, fetching all, deleting, and fetching by ID, which were implemented in the `product` route file.

7. User Routes: Lastly, in the `user` route file, I crafted routes for editing profiles and fetching user profiles.

Each route corresponds to a specific functionality, ensuring organized and efficient handling of requests within the application.

Additionally, respective controller functions were created to handle the logic for each route, maintaining separation of concerns and facilitating modular development.
